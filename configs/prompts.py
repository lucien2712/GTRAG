def _get_entity_extraction_template():
    return f"""---Goal---
Given a financial text document, identify all business entities and their relationships. Extract both entities and relationships following the structured format below.
Use English as output language.

---Steps---
1. Recognizing definitively conceptualized entities in text. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalize the name
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{', '.join(_load_entity_types().keys())}]. If the entity doesn't clearly fit any category, classify it as "Other".
- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities based on the information present in the input text. Do not add external knowledge.

2. Format each entity as:
("entity"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)

3. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are directly and clearly related based on the text. Unsubstantiated relationships must be excluded from the output.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
- relationship_description: Explain the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection

4. Format each relationship as:
("relationship"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_description>)

5. Use `<|>` as field delimiter. Use `##` as the list delimiter. Ensure no spaces are added around the delimiters.

6. When finished, output `<|COMPLETE|>`

7. Return identified entities and relationships in English.

---Quality Guidelines---
- Only extract entities that are clearly defined and meaningful in the financial/business context
- Avoid over-interpretation; stick to what is explicitly stated in the text
- Include specific numerical data in entity name when relevant (e.g., "Q4 2023 Revenue", "$65.8 billion")
- Ensure entity names are consistent throughout the extraction
- Focus on business-critical relationships that provide insights into corporate structures, market dynamics, and financial connections

---Entity Types---
{_ENTITY_TYPES_DESCRIPTION}

---Examples---
Input: "Apple Inc. reported iPhone sales revenue of $65.8 billion in Q4 2023, representing a 3% growth in the smartphone market."

Output:
("entity"<|>"Apple Inc."<|>"COMPANY"<|>"Major technology company specializing in consumer electronics and mobile devices")##
("entity"<|>"iPhone"<|>"PRODUCT"<|>"Apple's flagship smartphone product line")##
("entity"<|>"$65.8 billion revenue"<|>"FINANCIAL_METRIC"<|>"Total sales revenue from iPhone products in Q4 2023")##
("entity"<|>"Q4 2023"<|>"TIME_PERIOD"<|>"Fourth quarter of 2023 reporting period")##
("entity"<|>"Smartphone Market"<|>"MARKET"<|>"Mobile phone industry market segment showing 3% growth")##

You are an expert keyword extractor, specializing in analyzing user queries for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Your purpose is to identify both high-level and low-level keywords in the user's query that will be used for effective document retrieval.

---Goal---
Given a user query, your task is to extract two distinct types of keywords:
1. **high_level_keywords**: for overarching concepts or themes, capturing user's core intent, the subject area, or the type of question being asked.
2. **low_level_keywords**: for specific entities or details, identifying the specific entities, proper nouns, technical jargon, product names, or concrete items.

---Instructions & Constraints---
1. **Output Format**: Your output MUST be a valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown code fences (like ```json), or any other text before or after the JSON. It will be parsed directly by a JSON parser.
2. **Source of Truth**: All keywords must be explicitly derived from the user query, with both high-level and low-level keyword categories required to contain content.
3. **Concise & Meaningful**: Keywords should be concise words or meaningful phrases. Prioritize multi-word phrases when they represent a single concept. For example, from "latest financial report of Apple Inc.", you should extract "latest financial report" and "Apple Inc." rather than "latest", "financial", "report", and "Apple".
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: For queries that are too simple, vague, or nonsensical (e.g., "hello", "ok", "asdfghjkl"), you must return a JSON object with empty lists for both keyword types.

---Examples---
Example 1:

Query: "How does international trade influence global economic stability?"

Output:

  "high_level_keywords": ["International trade", "Global economic stability", "Economic impact"],
  "low_level_keywords": ["Trade agreements", "Tariffs", "Currency exchange", "Imports", "Exports"]

Output:

  "high_level_keywords": ["Environmental consequences", "Deforestation", "Biodiversity loss"],
  "low_level_keywords": ["Species extinction", "Habitat destruction", "Carbon emissions", "Rainforest", "Ecosystem"]
